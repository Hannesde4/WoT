This is a basic script to build a character in the browser, and than store it in google firestore realtime database. The last stored version will be showed on the raspberry pi.

You can also see the characters that where previously submitted, you can select on of these, and they will be showed on the raspberry pi.

Just simply run the script in the raspberry pi, and you're erady to go!
